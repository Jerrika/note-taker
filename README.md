## Description

The Expresss JS Note Taker is a simple, lightweight, and fast web application that allows users to write, save and delete notes on their own.


## The Challenge:

Create an application that uses Express.js on the back end by saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file. Once done, merge connect both the back end and front end of the application then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
